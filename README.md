# Technology : REACT Framework

## Introduction to React.Js

### 1.	What is React.js?

React.js is open source frontend JavaScript framework developed by Facebook to build UX to have single page application, it is the view* in MVC framework. It allows us to create reusable components.


### 2.	Why was React developed?

To create best user experience for the user using concept of single page application or SPA


### 3.	Who uses React?

Compnies like Dropbox, Netflix, Salesforce, IBM, AT&T, Netflix, WhatsApp uses React.

### 4.	React: the good

* Developed by Facebook.

* Create best user experience via SPA.

* Create re usable component i.e development is moduler.

* Think the development in term of OOPS.

* Usage virtual dom to update UI.

* Do not need to create logic update    UI when building feature like list just  change data in state the list will be updated.

* No need of direct manipulation of DOM.

5.	React: the bad

* Initial learning curve is very high espislay when user is good in jQuery.

 * As we think dom manipulation in terms of jQuery but now we need to think of state manipulation and as a result dom will be updated.

* If the dev usages large data set of array like length > 1000, the rendering UI or specially in typing text box is little bit slow, so need to handle properly

* Some times data flow is hard to understand


### 6.	Why should I use React?

* To create codebase maintainable in long term as it usages re usable component

* To create single page application

* To create best user UX


### 7.	Is switching to React easy?

Initial learning curve is high but need to think properly while switching to react
